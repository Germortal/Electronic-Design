HERE YOU WILL FIND A PAGE WITH INFORMATION ABOUT THE APPLICATION WE DEVELOPED AND THE APPLICATION TOO. WE TRY TO MAKE A PID CONTROL RESPONSE VIEWER TO TEST HOW THE CALCULATED VALUES OF OUR CONSTANTS, Ki, Kp AND Kd WILL PERFORM

THIS APP MIGHT BE UPDATED IN THE FUTURE, MAKING IT POSSIBLE TO SELECT THE TYPE OF CONTROLLER AND ALSO THE TRANSFER FUNCTION.
